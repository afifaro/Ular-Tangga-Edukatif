Ular Tangga Edukatif â€” Final v3 (Full Edition)

- This package uses the SheetJS CDN to provide full Excel parsing in-browser.
- If you need a fully offline package (no external CDN), download xlsx.full.min.js from https://cdn.sheetjs.com/xlsx-0.20.3/package/dist/xlsx.full.min.js and place it in /lib/ and update index.html to reference it locally.
- To replace audio placeholders with final MP3s (intro + voice anak-anak + sfx), put MP3 files into assets/audio/ and name them:
  - intro.mp3
  - voice-anak.mp3
  - dice.wav (or dice.mp3)
  - correct.wav
  - wrong.wav
  - move.wav
  - win.wav
- The questions.json is pre-populated from the Excel file you uploaded.
- To upload your own audio or real xlsx.full.min.js and want me to repackage, upload the files here and I will rebuild the ZIP for you.
